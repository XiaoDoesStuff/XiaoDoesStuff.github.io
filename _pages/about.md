Hi,
My name is Xiao, also known as XiaoDoesStuff. I am currently a college student with a strong focus on technology-related activities. I manage the XiaoDoeStuff YouTube Channel and an eBay selling account. My YouTube channel features a variety of technology-related videos, where I share my experiences with software, hardware configuration, and repair processes. On eBay, I sell consoles and other technology items that I have acquired, tested, repaired, and/or cleaned. I would appreiciate any support with followers on my social media platforms.
